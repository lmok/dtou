This document describes Data Terms of Use, an experimental idea in designed to give end-users control of data.

This repository represents draft ideas on the DTOU as a specification, and may ultimately serve as a normative set of specs. However at this point it is intended to serve as a public facing RfC and open community collaborative artefact. 

## Overview: DToU vs the Platform Web

The core idea of DTOU is to allow people to exprss preferences over how others see and interact with data artefacts they find "in the wild". 

For example, imagine if someone has shared a selfie with you.  How do you know what they want you to do with it? 

Do they want to know that you've looked at it?  Do they want feedback on whether you like or hate it?  Do you want them to keep it or to destroy it after they've looked at it? Would they mind it if you showed it to your best friend? What about their mother?

Today, such semantics are fixed within the platforms that we used to send and control our data.  For example, Snapchat automatically keeps track of when the receipient of your snap opens and views it, and allows you to specify exactly how long they have to look at it before it is automatically destroyed.  

Similarly, people know how to interact with tweets on Twitter because there are a fixed set of things the Twitter interface lets you do to interact with another person's tweet.  Namely, you can retweet, like, or reply to it.  And that's about it.

### What if there were another way?

What if the ability to interact with data were not dictated by platforms themselves, but were flexible, fluid and most of all, defined by end-users?
